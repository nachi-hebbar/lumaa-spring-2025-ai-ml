# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation Overview:

I built the content-based recommendation system using the following approach:

1. **Preprocessing of text**: Cleaning the dataset and removing null values
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting **movie overview** and **genre** into TF-IDF vectors.
3. **Weighted Cosine Similarity**: Weighted cosine similarity between user query and movie overview and genre, to get top 30 movies.
4. **Re-Ranking based on Popularity Score**: Re-rank the top 30 movies based on popularity. This ensures returning relevant and popular movies to the user.
5. **Recommendation**: Return top 10 movies to user


## 📌 Dataset

I’m using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset from Kaggle. Link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv. I have uploaded the same to this repo.

## ⚙️ Setup

Python 3.x (Tested on 3.10+)

If using Colab, just upload the dataset and run the cells.

## 🚀 Running the Code

In Google Colab or Jupyter, run all cells and execute the following function with a query:

recommend("I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist.")

It'll give you top 10 recommendations based on genre and plot similarity, re-ranked by popularity.

## 🎯 Example Output

Here’s results from a sample run:

Query: query="I like fun animated movies with talking animals, humor, and heartwarming adventures."
